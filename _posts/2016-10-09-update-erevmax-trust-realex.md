There is no clever design philosophy to talk about, I tried to find something to work with, and 'scribble' came to my mind. This theme uses Open Sans powered by Google Web Fonts, and was written in plain HTML, SCSS & CoffeeScript, though .scss & .coffee files wouldn't be included in the theme.

The theme is mobile optimised but I did not check browser compatibility. It looks great in Chrome, Safari and Firefox though.
