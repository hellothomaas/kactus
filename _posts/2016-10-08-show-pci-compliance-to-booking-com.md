There is no clever design philosophy to talk about, I tried to find something to work with, and 'scribble' came to my mind. This theme uses Open Sans powered by Google Web Fonts, and was written in plain HTML, SCSS & CoffeeScript, though .scss & .coffee files wouldn't be included in the theme.

The theme is mobile optimised but I did not check browser compatibility. It looks great in Chrome, Safari and Firefox though.

### Options

When writing a post, there are 3 options you can add to the header.

1. disqus: y

2. **share: y**<br />
  An option for showing tweet and like button under a post.

3. **date**: 2013-05-06 18:07:17<br />
  Date is not a required header since Jekyll reads the file name for date, this was added in only for the **signoff time**. (as shown at the end of this post) If you don't want the signoff time, go into `/includes/signoff.html` and remove the `<span>`.
